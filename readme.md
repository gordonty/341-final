<h1>Why my website is about reading</h1>
  <p>I love to read. It's one of my favorite things to do but sometimes I can get a little stuck. Therefore I decided to gather a few reviews and suggestions for others when they aren't sure if a book is any good or aren't sure what to read.</p>
  <p>I decided to include some quotes about reading as well to peak an individual's interest in reading</p>

<hr />
<br />

<h1>Where my content came from</h1>
  <p>Some content I came up with myself such as the book reviews done by myself which aren't very good. All the images I got off of the internet making sure that they were free to use by anyone. The review websites and quotes I had to do a little research to find. The quotes were obtained from goodreads.com, brainyquotes.com, and ebookfriendly.com. The wireframe sketches I did myself by hand and took the photos for documentation myself as well.</p>

<br />

<h1>How long it took me to create</h1>
  <p>Overall it took me a few hours a day for about two or three weeks, probably closer to two weeks. There was at least one Saturday and one Thursday where I worked on it all day.</p>

<br />

<h1>How long each process took</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><h5>Sketches</h5></li>
      <p>Creating the sketches didn't take me that long, I think it took me maybe an hour one evening or afternoon.</p>
    <li><h5>Gathering Material</h5></li>
      <p>Gathering the materials took a little longer as I had to sift and dig through information.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gathering quotes took me about a half hour to an hour as I already had an idea of where to look for them it was more of the skimming through and picking which quotes I wanted to use that took the time.</li>
        <li>Gathering pictures took about the same amount of time as gathering the quotes did. I just went to google and made sure that I filtered the pictures by usage rights that way I made sure to use images that were free to use by anyone. I also already had an idea of what images I wanted to use which helped cut down on how much time it took me.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><h5>Putting it all together/coding</h5></li>
      <p>This took the longest as it consisted of the most work. Putting everything together took at least a week to two weeks and consited of several hours each night. There were a few days were I worked all day to get things put together.</p>
  </ul>

<h1>Development</h1>
  <ol>
    <li><h5>what worked</h5></li>
      <p>The overall the paralex pages worked well; I was happy with them. At first the different designs for different devices worked (more on this later). Putting the pictures into the pages worked well this time around which was nice. Overall everything worked pretty well.</p>
    <li><h5>What gave me problems</h5></li>
      <p>I couldn't get my dropdown menu to work again. However this time the overflow was hidden which is progress from the last time I tried to do a dropdown. As I went on through the process of putting everything together the different designs for different devices decided to not work the way I would like and I couldn't figure out why. It was a little frusterating.</p>
    <li><h5>How did choices influence each other</h5></li>
      <ul>
        <li>The reading quotes influenced my choices of images for the most part. I tried to pick images that went well with and inhanced the quotes.</li>
        <li>The idea that each book and story is different influenced my choices of images for the alphabet used on the suggestions based on author page. This idea of reading actually influenced the overall design of the webpage in the sense that not everything is the same and there are lots of different things that capture an individuals attention.</li>
        <li>The different covers of all of the different books that I have on my bookshelf influenced my choice to use differnt colors instead of having a specific color palette. I tried to use warm and cool colors with each other so that they complimented one other.</li>
      </ul>
  </ol>

<h1>My thoughts</h1>
 <p>Overall I like how my website turned out. It's not perfect but I still have lots to learn. I don't like how long it took me to create so if I could go back I think I would simplify it a little. I also didn't start working on the final early enough which ment that I spent more time working on the site at once then I would have liked to. Not starting early enough also ment that I didn't get to go through a trial period of the website meaning I didn't get feed back on it.</p>

<h1>Documentation</h1>

  <p>Below is the documentation for my website. It is mainly the design wireframes. There are also images of some of the pages that had issues on them. There is not a lot of documentation</p>
