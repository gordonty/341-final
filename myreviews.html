    <h1>My Reviews</h1>
      <p>Below are some of my thoughts/ reviews on a few books that I have read. The reviews are not that good so no judging. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="review">
    <h3>Post-apocalyptic</h3>
      <div class="review one">
        <h6>Matched Trilogy by Ally Condie</h6>
        <p>An Interseting love story of a young woman who defies the rules of government to find her own love. I felt that they were very similar to other post-apocalyptic books but they are still a fairly good read.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="review two">
        <h6>The Selection Series by Kiera Cass</h6>
        <p>Wonderful love story of a girl who has to compete for the princes’ affection and together they change their city. Very good and captivating read. There are several novellas as well so you will have plenty to read.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="review three">
        <h6>The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins</h6>
        <p>A young woman defies the government to bring hope to people while fighting for her life. Good reads but more for the older kids as it does involve people killing each other for entertainment. It makes you think about the human race a little.</p>
      </div>

    <h3>Fantasy</h3>
      <div class="review four">
        <h6>Twilight Series by Stephanie Meyer</h6>
        <p>Young woman falls in love with vampire while her best friend is a werewolf. It is a love story but there is plenty of fighting for those who aren’t complete fans of the romance such as myself. Pretty good read but not much character development.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="review five">
        <h6>Harry Potter Series by J.K. Rowling</h6>
        <p>Wonderful read full of magic, friendship, and adventure. These books are full of adventure that can teach people about friendship, family, hope, and much more. If you are looking to escape for a while these are the books for you.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="review six">
        <h6>Merlin Series by T.A. Barron</h6>
        <p>I will admit I have not read the whole series yet. These books are an adventure of a young merliln before his service to King Arthur story. It's an interesting take on merlin's side of the King Arthur story.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="review seven">
        <h6>Tiger's Curse Series by Colleen Houck</h6>
        <p>Young women helps two Indian princes break their curse while falling in love and figuring out who to choose. This series has some Indian myths and beliefs which make it all the more interesting and gives you a taste of another culture. I couldn't put these books down.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Crime</h3>
      <div class="review eight">
        <h6>The Poisoner's Handbook by Deborah Blum</h6>
        <p>This book talks about different poisons and how forensic medicine came to be. It's interesting to read if you like learning about true crime and how forensic science developed. You do have to understand a little bit of chemistry to understand parts of this book.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="review nine">
        <h6>Fatal Voyage by Kathy Reichs</h6>
        <p>If you like the TV show Bones you will enjoy this book as it has a connection to the show. It's a good read. You can try solve the crime along with the characters.</p>
